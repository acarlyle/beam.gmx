/*
    Height should be the larger number for a phone resolution.  
    Width should be the larger factor for a Desktop / teevee.
    
    The above is how I'ce been coding the game.  However, it might be smarter to just force the game to
    be played horizontaly if on a teeny phone, so both version of the game favour the wide screen
    and I don't have to conduct wizardy with the level design.  GOOD IDEA ALEC.
